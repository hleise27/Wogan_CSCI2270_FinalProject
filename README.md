# Wogan_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:

I will be modifying a previous assignment for a specific data set. Using linked lists, arrays, and BST's, I will create a library that manages beer brewing ingredients. A set of files that contain on hand ingredients, such as speciality grains and hops, will be read in and sorted. The user will be able to search though his/her inventory or enter in a grain or hop. If the user has the entered ingredient, a list will populate that will display possible styles of beer that could be made. Also included in the read out wil be the option of displaying common commerical beers associated with that style. All metrics will be pulled from the 2008 BJCP Style guidelines.
