# Wogan_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:

I will be modifying a previous assignment for a specific data set. Using hash tables, I will create a library that manages beer brewing ingredients. A set of files that contain on hand ingredients, such as speciality grains and hops, will be read in and sorted. The user will be able to search though his/her inventory or enter in a base malt or specialty malt. If the user has the entered ingredient, a list will populate that will display possible styles of beer that could be made. Also included in the read out wil be the option of displaying common commerical beers associated with that style. All metrics will be pulled from the 2008 BJCP Style guidelines.

How to Run:
Import the (2x)source .cpp files, main.cpp, and (2x).h files into IDE. Run. 

When entering anything in to the terminal, be sure to start every word for with a capital letter. For example, if the option to insert a new ingredient is selected, instead of "pale malt"/ "Pale malt" use "Pale Malt". Likewise, when selecting options to search for various parameters, be sure to use the same format; "pale Malt" will return an incorrect value whereas "Pale Malt" will return an accurate result. 

Note: at the time of Phase 2, the only category in the program is Stout. As such, the avaiable selections for base/specialty malt are limited. 

Dependencies:

There are no external libraries or programs that are needed. 

System Requirements:
Program will run on any system that has a c++ complier. 

Group Members:
None

Contributers:

Open Issues/Bugs:

Entering the same name for an ingredient will break the program.

The only category available for use is Stout. It'd be great if more styles were included in the program. All relevent information is in the "2008 BJCP Style Guidelines", also in the repo.
